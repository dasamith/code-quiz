## Timed Quiz

A small app created for the purpose of learning a JavaScript programming language. The emphasis was on developing a good understanding of the basic priniciples of plain JavaScript without any additional libraries

As i proceed in my career as a web developer, i will probably be asked to complete a coding assessment, which is typically a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive challenges. Build a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Motivation
